<h2>What is this website for?</h2>
<p>
I am Taehwan Hwang who is from Seoul, South Korea and currently lives in NYC.
I love people all over the world. And my ultimate goal in my life is to help them.
I was thinkging what I can do for my friends. I found one thing, Wwhich is teaching and helping
my friends to learn korean. And I decided to make this website for them.
It is a small start. But I believe this small start will grow big.<br>

<h2>Why learning korean will open your eyes?</h2>

<p>
As a person who have been trying to understanding and learning English,
I found a very important fact. Learning a language is learning a new cultrue, new world and new perspective.
A lot of people from Asia are learning western culture and it opened their eyes.
But still, mayn native english speakers don't have denough time to learn Asian culture.
Hopefully, this website can expand your perspective over the globe<br>
